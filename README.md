A Novel Prediction of Heart Disease based on Ensemble Learning. This Project is Designsed only for the development purpose and not for the production. any data lose or any misuse of the data is not laiable to us. use this project at your own risk.

In this proposed system, CVD is detected and displayed in the web application. Cleveland Heart data are taken from the UCI. This dataset consists of 303 cases and 76 attributes/features. 13 features are used out of 76 features. In this application five algorithms are used with an additional Ensemble model .Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Algorithm, Multinomial_nb, Support vector machine, and Ensemble model are performed for detection purposes. After implementing above mentioned algorithms these are further deployed in python flask framework for graphical user interface and the target result of the prediction to be displayed in the application.

/* This application is developed and tested in windows 10 system only */ 

to run this application in your system please fllow below steps.

1. Install pythonfrom below links (32-bit / 64-bit) based on your systems configuration
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. after the installation is complete please check if the python and pip is added to PATH variable.
to add the python into PATH please follow these steps
    1. Right click on this pc / my computer
    2. Click on the properties
    3. On the upper left side on the window click on Advance System Settings
    4. In the System Properties click on Environmnt Variables
    5. Click on PATH variable and click Edit
    6. At this point head over to installation directory of Python and copy the path of the python 
    7. Go back to Environment Varibales and Click on New and Pate the path of python then click ok and close all the windows
    8. At this point after adding python to the PATH variable open cmd ( Command Prompt ) and type python and press Enter if the PATH is added correctly then the python Interpreter will be visible on the CMD as:
    
    Python 3.8.2 (tags/v3.8.2:7b3ab59, Feb 25 2020, 22:45:29) [MSC v.1916 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

    if the PATH is not added correctly then please check back the steps correctly.
3. After the python is setup, Now its time to sync the code from github.

4. After downloading the code from github please install all the necessary packages for the model to run
5. please follow this guide to install all the packages
