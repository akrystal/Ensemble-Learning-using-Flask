# Ensemble-Learning-using-Flask
A Novel Prediction of Heart Disease based on Ensemble Learning.In this proposed system, CVD is detected and displayed in the web application. Cleveland Heart data are taken from the UCI. This dataset consists of 303 cases and 76 attributes/features. 13 features are used out of 76 features. In this application five algorithms are used with an additional Ensemble model .Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Algorithm, Multinomial_nb, Support vector machine, and Ensemble model are performed for detection purposes. After implementing above mentioned algorithms these are further deployed in python flask framework for graphical user interface and the target result of the prediction to be displayed in the application.
